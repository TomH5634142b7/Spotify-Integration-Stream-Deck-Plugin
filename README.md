# ⚠️ This is far from complete.
This repo is here to show what's to come.

Progress on the Stream Deck plugin currently hasn't started yet as I'm getting the [Spicetify Custom API Extension](https://github.com/TomH5634142b7/Spicetify-Custom-API-Extension) ready first. This plugin will depend on the custom API extension.

# Spotify Integration Stream Deck Plugin
This plugin was built as an alternative to BarRaider's Spotify Integration which uses the Spotify Web API.

This plugin creates a local websocket server which will handle sending and receiving data from my custom webhook API extension for Spicetify.
